# Roadmap

* Add simplest authentication - done
* move authentication into its own controller
* create login page ( post )
* connect authentication to external database ( mongo )
* make authentication more secure ( hash, salt )
* add authorization ( logged in user can see some things, but not others )
* user can create document objects into mongo
* roles: admin, author, reader?
* more templates
